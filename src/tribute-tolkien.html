                Discovering a love for the literary arts at a young age, Tolkien was able to read at the tender age of four and learned to write soon afterwards.

                Tolkien lived through some of the most turbulent periods of human history, namely the World Wars. Indeed, the First World War broke out when he was in his early 20s.
              </p>
                His family members were not shy in expressing their distaste of his decision regarding putting off joining the war efforts when he elected to first complete his degree. Eventually, Tolkien started serving in the War in 1915, and would feature in a few prominent battles, such as the Battle of the Sommes in 1916.
              <p>
                Many of Tolkien's closest school friends died in the war - and Tolkien recalled that he himself was not a man born for warfare.

                Often being credited as the man who brought fantasy to the masses, Tolkien never expected any of his prose to become popular. He was convinced to publish one of his works, simply titled <i>The Hobbit</i>, by a publishing firm called George Allen & Unwin.
              </p>
              <p>
                Published on 21 September 1937, the book was a tremendous success and attracted readers young and old alike. Not much time passed after <i>The Hobbit</i>'s initial release until Tolkien was asked to write a sequal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tolkien started writing a sequal to <i>The Hobbit</i> in 1937. This sequal, which developed into a gigantic piece of work, was not finished until 1949, and even then Tolkien still made regular changes to it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Eventually split into three separate tomes, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> became one of the best-selling books of all time.

                Although Tolkien had been working on <i>The Silmarillion</i> shortly after the publication of <i>The Hobbit</i>, it wasn't published until after his death. Christopher Tolkien, who edited much of his father's work, was the one who eventually published this work. Tolkien initially presented <i>The Silmarillion</i> as a potential sequal to <i>The Hobbit</i>, although Unwin thought that the work was too obscure and "Celtic".
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>The Silmarillion</i> was eventually published in 1977, roughly four years after J.R.R. Tolkien's death.
              </p>
              <p>
                Christopher Tolkien continued editing much of his father's work, such as the tragic <i>The Children of Húrin</i> (2007) and <i>The Fall of Gondolin</i> (2018), before dying at the age of 95 on 16 January 2020.

                Tolkien was not perfect, but his life was very interesting and worth the read. I recommend a book called J.R.R Tolkien: A Biography by Humphrey Carpenter.
